  abstract  = {We benchmark the quantum processing units of the largest quantum annealers to date, the 5000+qubit quantum annealer Advantage and its 2000+ qubit predecessor D-Wave 2000Q, using tail assignment and exact cover problems from aircraft scheduling scenarios. The benchmark set contains small, intermediate, and large problems with both sparsely connected and almost fully connected instances. We find that Advantage outperforms D-Wave 2000Q for almost all problems, with a notable increase in success rate and problem size. In particular, Advantage is also able to solve the largest problems with 120 logical qubits that D-Wave 2000Q cannot solve anymore. Furthermore, problems that can still be solved by D-Wave 2000Q are solved faster by Advantage. We find, however, that D-Wave 2000Q can achieve better success rates for sparsely connected problems that do not require the many new couplers present on Advantage, so improving the connectivity of a quantum annealer does not per se improve its performance.}

abstract = {Sound methodologies for constructing security-critical systems are extremely important in order to confront the increasingly varied security threats. As a response to this need, Model-Driven Security has emerged in the early 2000s as a specialized Model-Driven Engineering approach for supporting the development of security-critical systems. In this chapter we summarize the most important developments of Model-Driven Security during the past decade. In order to do so we start by building a taxonomy of the most important concepts of this domain. We then use our taxonomy to describe and evaluate a set of representative and influential Model-Driven Security approaches in the literature. In our development of this topic we concentrate on the concepts shared by Model-Driven Engineering and Model-Driven Security. This allows us to identify and debate the advantages, disadvantages, and open issues when applying Model-Driven Engineering to the Information Security domain. This chapter provides a broad view of Model-Driven Security and is intended as an introduction to Model-Driven Security for students, researchers, and practitioners.}
