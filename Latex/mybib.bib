  abstract  = {We benchmark the quantum processing units of the largest quantum annealers to date, the 5000+qubit quantum annealer Advantage and its 2000+ qubit predecessor D-Wave 2000Q, using tail assignment and exact cover problems from aircraft scheduling scenarios. The benchmark set contains small, intermediate, and large problems with both sparsely connected and almost fully connected instances. We find that Advantage outperforms D-Wave 2000Q for almost all problems, with a notable increase in success rate and problem size. In particular, Advantage is also able to solve the largest problems with 120 logical qubits that D-Wave 2000Q cannot solve anymore. Furthermore, problems that can still be solved by D-Wave 2000Q are solved faster by Advantage. We find, however, that D-Wave 2000Q can achieve better success rates for sparsely connected problems that do not require the many new couplers present on Advantage, so improving the connectivity of a quantum annealer does not per se improve its performance.}

abstract = {Sound methodologies for constructing security-critical systems are extremely important in order to confront the increasingly varied security threats. As a response to this need, Model-Driven Security has emerged in the early 2000s as a specialized Model-Driven Engineering approach for supporting the development of security-critical systems. In this chapter we summarize the most important developments of Model-Driven Security during the past decade. In order to do so we start by building a taxonomy of the most important concepts of this domain. We then use our taxonomy to describe and evaluate a set of representative and influential Model-Driven Security approaches in the literature. In our development of this topic we concentrate on the concepts shared by Model-Driven Engineering and Model-Driven Security. This allows us to identify and debate the advantages, disadvantages, and open issues when applying Model-Driven Engineering to the Information Security domain. This chapter provides a broad view of Model-Driven Security and is intended as an introduction to Model-Driven Security for students, researchers, and practitioners.}

abstract="Quantum computing is getting closer and closer to bringing all its potential applications to our lives. This means that in a few years the current IT will evolve into hybrid software systems where quantum and classical computing paradigms should be designed, developed, and operated together. This is a big challenge that will require software modernization processes for transforming and migrating legacy software systems (which may include adding new existing quantum software) toward such hybrid software systems. This chapter discusses the challenges of hybrid software and how software modernization (based on architecture-driven modernization) can be used as a reengineering solution for an effective evolution of classical and quantum software.",

abstract="Thanks to the last engineering advances, quantum computing is gaining an increasing importance in many sectors that will be benefited from its superior computational power. Before achieving all those promising benefits, companies must be able to combine their classical information systems and the new quantum software to operate with the so-called hybrid information systems. This implies, at some point of such a modernization process, that hybrid information systems will have to be (re)designed. UML can be used for defining abstract design models, not only for the classical part as done before, but also for the quantum software in an integrated manner. This paper proposes a model transformation for generating UML models that represents quantum circuits as activity diagrams. Thanks to the usage of UML, these designs are technological-independent which contributes to the modernization of hybrid information systems. The outgoing UML models are compliant with a vast amount of design tools and might be understood by a big community.",

abstract = { Quantum computing has gained a lot of interest in recent years, thanks to its ability to solve certain problems that classical computing cannot address. These applications will only be achieved through the development of quantum software. Thus, many organizations are starting projects to integrate this new software into their existing systems. Software modernization (as based on Model-Driven Engineering) can be used to migrate from/to the so-called hybrid software systems, which integrate classical and quantum software. In that process, reverse engineering and restructuring phases have already been addressed, but the forward engineering phase for hybrid software has not yet been addressed. This paper presents a preliminary code generation technique from extended UML design models. It proposes an EGL transformation to generate Python and Qiskit code by integrating classical and quantum code. The transformation has been preliminarily validated with an example of application with the design model of a hybrid system for a financial web application. The implication of this work is that the software modernization process for hybrid software systems is completed, which facilitates the adoption of this new paradigm in the industry. },

abstract="The interest on quantum computing has grown dramatically due to its incomparable computation power and many promising applications. This new computing paradigm influences the way on how future information systems will be built. Legacy, classical systems cannot be simply replaced with quantum software by several reasons. First, legacy systems usually embed a lot of mission-critical knowledge over time, making its replacing too risky. Second, some business processes do not make sense to be supported through quantum computing because it supposes unnecessary expenses. This signifies that organizations need to adapt their classical information systems alongside new specific quantum applications, evolving toward hybrid information systems. Unfortunately, there are not specific methods for dealing with this challenge. We believe reengineering, and more specifically software modernization using model-driven engineering principles, could be useful for migrating classical systems toward hybrid ones. In particular, this paper presents a reverse engineering technique that analyses quantum software information from Q{\#} code and generates more abstract models. These models are generated according to the Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) standard. The main implication is that through the usage of KDM the reengineering toward hybrid systems can be accomplished in an independent way regarding the specific quantum technology.",

abstract = {Quantum computing systems rely on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform a multitude of computationally challenging tasks more efficiently than their classical counterparts. The architecture of software-intensive systems can empower architects who can leverage architecture-centric processes, practices, description languages to model, develop, and evolve quantum computing software (quantum software for short) at higher abstraction levels. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the SLR indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process. Results of this SLR can facilitate researchers and practitioners to develop new hypotheses to be tested, derive reference architectures, and leverage architecture-centric principles and practices to engineer emerging and next generations of quantum software.}

We have closely examined instances of quantum software engineering, quantum modeling languages, quantum design patterns, and quantum communication security to gain insights into the distinctive attributes associated with various software architecture approaches.
Results:
Our findings underscore the critical significance of prioritizing software architecture in the development of robust and efficient quantum software systems. Through the synthesis of these multifaceted aspects, both researchers and practitioners can devise quantum software solutions that are inherently architecture-centric.
Conclusion:
The software architecture of quantum computing systems plays a pivotal role in determining their ultimate success and usability. Given the ongoing advancements in quantum computing technology, the migration of traditional software architecture development methods to the domain of quantum software development holds significant importance.}

abstract = {Quantum programming languages provide necessary constructs to program quantum computers. To write such programs, one needs to understand the characteristics of quantum computers such as superposition and entanglement, which are novel as compared to programming with classical computers. Understanding these characteristics requires an understanding of quantum physics. Thus, there is a need to build high-level modeling abstractions of quantum programs for software engineers who are used to program on classical computers to understand and model quantum programs at a high-level of abstraction and independent of quantum platforms. To this end, we present some ideas for developing such quantum software modeling languages, by presenting a conceptual model of quantum programs and an example of modeling the state-based behavior of quantum entanglement program. Moreover, we present some open issues in the area of modeling quantum programs.},
