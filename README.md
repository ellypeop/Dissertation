I wanted to pursue a main project related to quantum computing due to an interest in the topic. QUML presented an opportunity to work within this domain without heavily relying on physics knowledge, which I do not possess a strong background in. I contacted Carlos and read the paper linked in the forum - [Towards a Quantum Software Modeling Language](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3387940.3392183)

I initially met with Carlos and was given additional reading: [A Quantum Software Modeling Language](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-05324-5_6). I understood that the project would be related to how quantum computers can be represented in UML. I believe UML is an achievable language to learn and base my main project on, and I would have the opportunity to better understand quantum computers.
