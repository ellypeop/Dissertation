  abstract = "A unified view of the Information System (IS) design is essential for dealing with complexity. However, the literature proposes many denominations, depending on the layer, methodology, framework, or tool. This multitude of approaches does not allow a holistic view of the system. Besides, in Information Systems, the search for good practices in design is still a relevant issue. A subset of essential Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams is chosen to create a broad view of the IS. CRUD matrix is one of the preferred approaches to articulate the sub-systems of applications and data. Axiomatic Design (AD) provides rules for the improvement of the IS design. This work presents a method to create object-oriented elements based on the CRUD matrix aligned with the business strategy. An integrated student-based case study on logistics is provided. In the discussion, a new IS architect role is proposed supported by the CRUD/AD method."

  abstract  = {Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.}
