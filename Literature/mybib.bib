  abstract = "A unified view of the Information System (IS) design is essential for dealing with complexity. However, the literature proposes many denominations, depending on the layer, methodology, framework, or tool. This multitude of approaches does not allow a holistic view of the system. Besides, in Information Systems, the search for good practices in design is still a relevant issue. A subset of essential Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams is chosen to create a broad view of the IS. CRUD matrix is one of the preferred approaches to articulate the sub-systems of applications and data. Axiomatic Design (AD) provides rules for the improvement of the IS design. This work presents a method to create object-oriented elements based on the CRUD matrix aligned with the business strategy. An integrated student-based case study on logistics is provided. In the discussion, a new IS architect role is proposed supported by the CRUD/AD method."
